GitHub Scraping Example, Pod Akash and Aadarsh 

### What's Done

So far, we've gone ahead and scraped the website for you via a `GET` request via Python. This means that we've saved the webpage to a `.html` file. 

### What's next

Make sure that you: 
1. Fetch the table 
2. Find the content
3. Load it up into a Python data structure. 

Right now, the table has been saved as a `raw_table` variable. But, you will need to extract the data, using data parsing, and load it into a Python data structure of your choice. 

That's it! Let us know if you need any help!
