GitHub Scraping Example, Pod Akash and Aadarsh 

### What's Done

So far, we've gone ahead and scraped the website for you via a `GET` request via Python. This means that we've saved the webpage to a `.html` file. 

### What's next

Make sure that you: 
1. Fetch the table 
2. Find the content
3. Load it up into a Python data structure. 

That's it! Let us know if you need any help!
